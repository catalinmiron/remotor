	<h1>Remote Software Development Jobs</h1>
	<div class="intro">
	<p>I firmly believe that the future of work is remote. I used to live out in the
    west of Spain where there were very few job
	opportunities, but got by on remote consulting work.</p>
	<p>The original idea was to gather links to Python development jobs from a
	whole lot of websites which carry ads for remote work. It has since
	expanded to include other languages.</p>
	<p>This site is run on a totally voluntary basis and we aren't taking any
	kind of a cut or kickback from the job sites.</p>
    <p>It's a work in progress so apologies in advance for the roughness
    around the edges. If you'd like to contribute to polishing it, feel free to
    fork the project which is up on Github 
    <a href="https://github.com/jamiebull1/remotor">here</a>. PRs gratefully accepted.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Good luck with the job-hunting!</p>
